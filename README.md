# Vue 3 Facets

Fully-typed Vue 3 Facets implementation. This is a simple implementation of a Facets composable that allows you to filter a list of items based on a set of facets.

Currently this is a "bad performance version" as I still didnt figure out how / which approach to use to reduce the O(N) complexity of the filtering.

## How to run

install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

run the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit the app at the URL shown in the terminal and start using the facets and see how they work
